        <ul>
            <li> When I started liking this album, I could'nt really relate to it. It displayed too much concepts of love which was not something I was very fond of but enjoyed listening to it because I was curius as to how being in love feels. </li>
            <li> It makes you feel like you're in love even if you don't really have someone special</li>
            <li> As I listen to it more and more, I learn that it isn't all about being in love. It also expresses pain and compassion for yourself and even your friends.</li>
            <li> Overall, nonskip album!!</li>
