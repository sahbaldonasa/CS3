            <li> I've never really experienced a heartbreak but THIS ALBUM reaaaally makes you feel all the pain you could ever imagine.</li>
            <li> I love this album so much even just hearing the intro makes me want to scream to the extent that I'll break my bones.</li>
            <li> THE LINEUP. Fun fact: the album has 3 singles that are actually connected!! Which for me is very amazing.</li>
